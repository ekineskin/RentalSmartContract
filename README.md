# Paribu-Hub Smart Contract & Solidity Bootcamp Task 2

## Project Description

This project contains a Solidity smart contract for managing rental agreements for homes and shops. The smart contract is used to manage tenant information, address details, owner information, and rental contracts for the rental properties.

The main objectives of the project are as follows:
- Create and manage rental properties.
- Initiate and terminate rental contracts.
- Allow homeowners to add their properties.

## Usage

You can use this smart contract by following the steps below:

### 1. Compile and Deploy the Project

First, use the Solidity compiler to compile the project and deploy it to an Ethereum network.

### 2. Adding Properties

As a homeowner, add your properties to the smart contract. Specify the type of your property (home or shop), owner information, and other necessary details.

### 3. Starting a Rental Contract

When you find a property you want to rent, initiate a rental contract. Provide the tenant's identity, the rental start date, and optionally the end date.

### 4. Terminating the Lease

When the lease term is over or for any other reason you want to terminate the lease, use the contract to end the rental contract. This can be done by the property owner or the tenant.

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Set up a Solidity development environment.
4. Compile and deploy the smart contract.
